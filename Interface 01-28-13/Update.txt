1. Finished the main body of interfaces for Welcome, DocSignIn, PatientSignIn, ChangePassword. 
2. Driver contains main() used to start the whole program.
3. Combined the previous XXFrame.java and XXPanel.java into XX.java.
4. DocSignIn and PatientSignIn are basically the same. I was just not sure how to name a button in the Welcome interface if we put doctor and patient in the same button. So I just made two buttons.
5. Things needed to complete: 
(1) In Welcome: the Admin Button.
(2) In SignIn: check if password of certain ID is correct.
(3) In ChangePassword: confirm the new password is correct (same with what in the Confirm textfield, and different with the old one); submit stores the new password, check if current user is a doctor or a patient. If it is a doctor, move to SearchPatient; else move to history.
